# Task_06_Deep_Fake

Process Documentation: AI-Generated Interview Experiment
Project Focus: PROCESS OVER PRODUCT
This repository documents my exploration of transforming Task 5's statistical analysis into an AI-generated "deep fake" interview. The emphasis is on documenting the journey, tools tried, and workflow development rather than creating a perfect final product.

My Approach & Methodology
My Strategic Approach

Content-First Strategy: Start with script development before worrying about voice generation
Iterative Experimentation: Try multiple tools and document what works/doesn't work
Free Tool Focus: Test only free resources as instructed
Process Documentation: Record every step, including failures and pivots

My Script Development Process
Iteration 1: The Analytical Approach
What I Tried: Direct conversion of Task 5 statistics into Q&A format
Problems I Encountered:

Sounded too formal and academic
Lacked natural conversation flow
Numbers felt forced into dialogue

Learning: Raw data doesn't translate directly to natural speech
Iteration 2: Character Development First
What I Changed: Created detailed personas before writing dialogue

Sarah Mitchell: Sports journalist, curious but professional
Coach Treanor: Analytical coach, player-focused

Improvement: Much more natural-sounding conversation
Still Needed Work: Transitions between topics felt abrupt
Iteration 3: Conversational Flow Focus
What I Refined:

Added natural speech patterns ("Well," "Here's what I see...")
Created logical question progression
Included coaching-specific language

Result: Finally sounded like a real interview!
My Final Script Development Insights:

Character development is crucial - spent more time on personas than expected
Multiple iterations necessary - first draft was terrible, needed 4-5 revisions
Reading aloud helps - caught unnatural phrasing that looked fine on paper
Statistical accuracy tricky - had to double-check numbers through each revision


Challenges I Encountered & How I Handled Them
Challenge 1: Character Limits on Free Tools
Problem: ElevenLabs only allows 10k characters/month free
My Solution:

Condensed 6-minute interview to 3 minutes
Prioritized most impactful statistics and insights
Created "core message" version focusing on key findings

What I Learned: Constraints force better content curation
Challenge 2: Voice Authenticity
Problem: Finding AI voices that sounded like believable interview participants
My Experiments:

Tested 8+ different voices across platforms
Tried matching voice age to character profiles
Experimented with different speaking speeds and tones

What Worked:

Slightly older female voices for coach authority
Professional but warm voices for journalist
Slowing down speech by 10-15% improved naturalness

Challenge 3: Maintaining Statistical Accuracy
Problem: Numbers kept getting lost or changed through script iterations
My System:

Created "fact-check sheet" with all Task 5 statistics
Verified every number after each script revision
Used exact phrasing like "two hundred sixty-eight goals" vs "268 goals"

Result: Maintained 100% accuracy through final version
Challenge 4: Natural Conversation Flow
Problem: Early versions sounded like scripted Q&A, not interview
My Approach:

Studied real sports interviews for phrasing patterns
Added follow-up questions and natural transitions
Included coaching-specific terminology and journalist questioning style

Breakthrough Moment: When I stopped trying to include ALL statistics and focused on natural conversation flow

What I Actually Produced vs. What I Planned
Original Ambitious Plan:

6-minute comprehensive interview
Video with AI avatars
Professional broadcast quality
Coverage of all Task 5 findings

What I Actually Created:

3-minute focused interview script
Audio-only approach (video too complex for free tools)
High-quality dialogue preserving key insights
Concentrated on most impactful statistics

Why I Pivoted:

Tool Limitations: Free video options were not viable
Time Constraints: Audio production more manageable scope
