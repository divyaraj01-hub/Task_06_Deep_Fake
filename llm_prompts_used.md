 # Overview
This documents all the prompts I used with Claude to develop the interview script, including the ones that didn't work well. I'm sharing the actual prompts, not cleaned-up versions, to show the real experimental process.

# Phase 1: Initial Content Extraction
Prompt 1: First Attempt at Content Analysis
Purpose: Extract key insights from Task 5
Based on my Task 5 research about Syracuse Women's Lacrosse statistics, help me identify the most important findings that would make good interview content. The key data points were:
- Team scored 268 goals at 46% shooting
- Meaghan Tyrrell: 52 goals, 58.4% shooting  
- Emma Ward: 31 goals, 19 assists
- Strategic recommendation was to focus on offense over defense

What are the 5-7 most compelling talking points for a sports interview?
Claude's Response: Provided good structural framework, but too academic in tone
My Reaction: "This is a good start but needs more interview-specific angle"
Prompt 2: Interview Angle Development
Purpose: Get more interview-focused insights
I'm creating a fake AI interview between a sports journalist and a lacrosse coach. The journalist would want to ask engaging questions, and the coach would want to highlight strategic thinking and player development. 

Based on the Syracuse stats I mentioned, what kinds of questions would a real sports journalist ask? What would be the most interesting angles?
Claude's Response: Much better! Gave me question frameworks and story angles
My Reaction: "Now we're talking. This feels more like real sports media."

# Phase 2: Character Development
Prompt 3: Journalist Character Creation
Purpose: Develop Sarah Mitchell persona
Help me create a detailed character profile for Sarah Mitchell, a sports journalist who covers Syracuse athletics. She's interviewing the women's lacrosse coach about statistical analysis of the season. 

I want her to be:
- Professional but approachable
- Good at translating stats for general audience  
- Curious about player development stories
- Experienced enough to ask follow-up questions

What would her background be? How would she speak? What's her interview style?
Claude's Response: Great detailed persona that I used throughout
My Reaction: "Perfect foundation. She feels like a real person now."
Prompt 4: Coach Character Creation
Purpose: Develop Coach Treanor persona
Now create a character profile for Coach Jennifer Treanor - Syracuse women's lacrosse head coach (fictional for this exercise). She should be:
- Analytically minded but not robotic
- Passionate about player development  
- Uses data to make decisions but still emphasizes relationships
- Speaks with coaching authority but remains warm

What's her coaching philosophy? How does she talk about players? What language patterns would she use?
Claude's Response: Excellent coaching voice that felt authentic
My Reaction: "She sounds like coaches I've heard in real interviews. Good balance of analytics and emotion."

# Phase 3: Script Development Attempts
Prompt 5: First Script Attempt (DISASTER)
Purpose: Generate initial interview dialogue
Write a 5-minute interview between Sarah Mitchell (journalist) and Coach Treanor about the Syracuse lacrosse statistics. Include these key points:
- Team efficiency (268 goals, 46% shooting)
- Meaghan Tyrrell's performance (52 goals, 58.4%)  
- Emma Ward development opportunity
- Strategic focus on offense vs defense
- Concrete goals for next season

Make it sound like a real sports interview.
Claude's Response: Way too formal and academic sounding
My Reaction: "This is terrible. Sounds like a research presentation, not an interview."
Prompt 6: Conversational Style Fix
Purpose: Make dialogue more natural
The interview you just wrote sounds way too formal and academic. Real sports interviews are more conversational. Can you rewrite it with:
- More natural speech patterns
- Less formal language
- Follow-up questions that build on previous answers
- Coaching terminology that sounds authentic
- Some personality and emotion

Keep all the same statistics but make it sound like real people talking.
Claude's Response: Much better! Started to sound conversational
My Reaction: "Getting warmer. Now it sounds like humans, not robots."
Prompt 7: Natural Speech Enhancement
Purpose: Add realistic speech patterns
This is better but still needs work. Real people in interviews use speech patterns like:
- "Well, the first thing that jumps out..."  
- "Here's what I love about those numbers..."
- "You know what doesn't show up in the stats?"
- Natural transitions between topics

Can you revise the interview to include more of these natural speech patterns while keeping all the statistical accuracy?
Claude's Response: Significant improvement in naturalness
My Reaction: "Now we're getting somewhere! This sounds like people actually talking."

# Phase 4: Length and Structure Optimization
Prompt 8: Length Reality Check
Purpose: Reduce to 3-minute target
This interview is too long - about 8 minutes when I read it aloud. I need to get it down to 3 minutes while keeping the most important insights. 

Can you help me identify which parts are most essential and which could be cut? I absolutely need to keep:
1. The team efficiency discussion
2. Emma Ward as development priority  
3. Strategic decision about offense focus
4. Specific measurable goals

What can be shortened or eliminated?
Claude's Response: Good editing suggestions with rationale
My Reaction: "Smart cuts. This will help me focus on the core message."
Prompt 9: Condensed Version Creation
Purpose: Create final 3-minute version
Based on your suggestions, can you rewrite this as a tight 3-minute interview that covers:
1. Opening - team stats overview
2. Star player balance (Meaghan) and development priority (Emma)
3. Strategic decision-making (offense focus) 
4. Concrete goals for improvement
5. Brief closing

Keep the natural speech patterns we developed but make every word count.
Claude's Response: Excellent condensed version that became my foundation
My Reaction: "Perfect length and still covers everything important!"

# Phase 5: Accuracy and Polish
Prompt 10: Statistical Verification
Purpose: Ensure all numbers are correct
I need to double-check every statistic in this interview against my original Task 5 data. Here are the exact numbers:
- Team: 268 goals, 46.0% shooting
- Meaghan Tyrrell: 52 goals, 58.4% shooting, 2.89 goals/game
- Emma Ward: 31 goals, 19 assists, 46.3% shooting, 32 draw controls
- Kate Mashewske: 28 assists
- Attackers: 144 goals, Midfielders: 112 goals

Can you verify every number mentioned in the interview script is exactly correct?
Claude's Response: Found several small errors I needed to fix
My Reaction: "Good catch! Accuracy is crucial for credibility."
Prompt 11: TTS Optimization
Purpose: Format for voice generation
I need to optimize this script for text-to-speech generation. Can you:
1. Spell out all numbers as words (268 = "two hundred sixty-eight")
2. Make sure names are spelled clearly for pronunciation  
3. Add natural pause indicators where needed
4. Format it so I can easily copy sections for different AI voices

Keep the content identical, just optimize the format.
Claude's Response: Perfect TTS-ready formatting
My Reaction: "Exactly what I need for voice generation!"

# Phase 6: Character Voice Refinement
Prompt 12: Sarah's Voice Consistency
Purpose: Ensure journalist character consistency
Looking at just Sarah Mitchell's lines in this interview, do they all sound like they're coming from the same person? She should consistently:
- Ask professional but engaging questions
- Build questions logically from previous answers
- Use accessible language for general audience
- Show curiosity about player development

Are there any lines that don't fit this character profile?
Claude's Response: Identified a couple of inconsistencies to fix
My Reaction: "Good eye. Character consistency is crucial for believability."
Prompt 13: Coach's Voice Consistency
Purpose: Ensure coaching character consistency
Now look at Coach Treanor's responses. She should consistently:
- Show analytical thinking but with emotion
- Use coaching terminology naturally  
- Demonstrate passion for player development
- Connect statistics to practical coaching decisions

Do all her responses fit this character profile? Any that need adjustment?
Claude's Response: Minor tweaks needed for voice consistency
My Reaction: "These small adjustments really help with authenticity."
